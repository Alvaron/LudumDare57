# The Chase Beneath

For the theme “Depths” I went with a Horror Adventure game set in the sewers.

> Something chased you through town that night.
> You tripped and fell. Now you’ve woken up in the depths of the sewer system. You did you best to get out…

Find your way through the maze of sewers and avoid the hazards. Puzzle your way out (if that’s even possible)!
